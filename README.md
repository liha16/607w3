## Stand()

In the assignent, one of the requirements is to implement the operation Game::Stand. I implemented it but later modified it to remove duplicated code. The program is no longer matching the seq. diagram but it fullfills low coupling/high cohesion.


## Observer pattern

The dealer (model.dealer) is the publisher and the controller (controller.PlayGame) is the subscriber.
